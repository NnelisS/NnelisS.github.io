		  <h2>Niels Henning</h2>
		  <p class="large rise">My name is Niels Henning, and I’m 18 years old. 
			I live in the Netherlands and my hobbies are gaming, making games and go to the gym. 
			I also did gymnastics and badminton. 
			In my free time I don’t hesitate to play some video games or create something new in Unity. 
			My favorite games to play have to be Valorant and Rocket League. 
			In my game developing world my preferences go to 3D games because I find them way more fun to make and much cooler. 	
			When I think about a new idea in my own game	
			I always think about how I can upgrade that thing that I´m making. 
			For instance when I add a button to my game how can I make that button look cool, do I add an animation, do I add special effects to it. 
			Being a game developer is a lot of fun and u meet a lot of people with the same preferences for games or films as me. 
			U can find lots of people to play games with or even make a game with.			
			In the future I want to know more about game developing that´s why every time I find a new function that I don´t know about I use for my game. 
			When I write code I will keep using this function so I can practice using it and find all new sorts of ways to use it in different functions.			
			I don´t really have soft skills for game developing but when it comes to a problem I usually go to the first helping hand that´s close to me, like a friend or just look it up on the internet. 
			The only hard thing about coding is AI (artificial intelligence). 
			I find this hard because I need to make scripts that work on their own, so it has it´s own brain and I think it's hard to make hard code for AI.			
			For the rest I don´t have any problems with programming. 
			I know a lot about programming, but there is a lot more to learn.</p>
