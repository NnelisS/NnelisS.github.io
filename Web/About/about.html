		  <h2>Niels Henning</h2>
		  <p>My name is Niels Henning, and I’m 18 years old. I live in the Netherlands and my hobbies are gaming, making games and go to the gym. I also did gymnastics and badminton. I have a job as a grocery delivery man at Picnic and in my free time I don’t hesitate to play some video games. My favorite games to play have to be Valorant and Rocket League. In my game  developing world my preferences go to 3D games because I find them way more fun to make and much cooler. 
			
			 
			
			When I think about a new idea in my own game
			
			I always think about how I can upgrade that thing that I´m making. For instance when I add a button to my game how can I make that button look cool, do I add an animation, do I add special effects to it. Being a game developer is a lot of fun and u meet a lot of people with the same preferences for games or films as me. U can find lots of people to play games with or even make a game with.
			
			In the future I want to know more about game developing that´s why every time I find a new function that I don´t know about I use for my game. When I write code I will keep using this function so I can practice using it and find all new sorts of ways to use it in different functions.
			
			I don´t really have soft skills for game developing but when it comes to a problem I usually go to the first helping hand  that´s close to me, like a friend or just look it up on the internet. The only hard thing about coding is AI (artificial intelligence). I find this hard because I need to make scripts that work on their own, so it has it´s own brain and I think it's hard to make hard code for AI.
			
			For the rest I don´t have any problems with programming. I know a lot about programming, but there is a lot more to learn.</p>
