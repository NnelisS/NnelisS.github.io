                    <p>
                        For this 1 week gamejam project the theme was zombies. 
                        our idea for the game was to make a shopping game because in an apocalypse u need food and water to survive. <br> 
                        
                        You made a list of groceries you need to get at the supermarket and start running thru to get all groceries. <br>
                        but along the way you find a lot of zombies. 
                        Grab a cactus that’s on the ground and attack the zombies to kill them.</p>
<pre><code>    public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehabiour
    {
        private Rigibody2D rb;
        private Vector2 movement;

        [SerializeField] private float speed = 2;

        void Start(){ rb = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;(); }

        void Update()
        {
            movement.y = Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical");
            movement.x = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal");
        }

        private void FixedUpdate(){
            movement = movement.normalized;
            rb.MovePosition(rb.position + movement * speed * Time.FixedDeltatime);
        }
    }</code></pre>

                    <p>By the looks of it I made a pretty easy and basic movement script for the player to walk around, but since I was just a starting developer it was the perfect assignment to start with.</p>
<pre><code>    public void CheckMovement()
    {
        xAxis = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        yAxis = Input.GetAcis("Vertical");
        if (xAxis == 0 && yAxis == 0)
            playerState = PlayerState.idle;
        else
            playerstate = PlayerState.walking;

        if (yAxis > 0)
        {
            Debug.Log("Moving up");
            lookDirection = LookDirection.up;
        }
        else if (yAxis < 0)
        {
            Debug.Log("Moving down");
            lookDirection = LookDirection.down;
        }
        else if (xAxis < 0)
        {
            Debug.Log("Moving left");
            lookDirection = LookDirection.left;
        }
        else if (xAxis > 0)
        {
            Debug.Log("Moving right");
            lookDirection = LookDirection.right;
        }
    }

    public void SetAnimPlayerState(PlayerState state)
    {
        playerState = state;
        anim.SetInteger("Playerstate", (int)playerstate);
    }

    public LookDirection GetDirection() { return lookDirection }
</code></pre>
                    <p>Then I made animations based on what direction the player was moving to. 
                       For the zombies animations were looped with the sprites it had so there was no script needed for them. 
                       This was my first time animating in unity and from this point on I started animating in almost every project I've developed.<br><br><br><br></p>
