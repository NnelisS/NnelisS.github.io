            <h1>- Project: Minimal Prototype Design</h1>
            <h1>– Duration: 4 Weeks</h1>
            <h1>– Team: 1 Devs</h1>
            <p>My Part: Contract, Room Design, Mini games, Footstep manager, Lamp Manager, Window Manager, Door Manager, Event System,  Sound Manager, Animations, Cutscenes</p>
            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>For this project I signed an own made contract and made everything I put in the contract. 
                I made a game that looked like the Five Nights at Freddy’s type games that you need to survive till 6 AM. 
                Keep the lights on is a game in which the player has to try to get as much sleep as possible but his room is haunted by a monster that disturbs your sleep. 
                Change lights, close windows and hide to survive the night <br><br></p>
            <h2>Gameplay (Extended)</h2>
            <p>
                The players make sure to keep their eyes closed as long as possible to get some sleep in bed.
                When the lights in your room go out get out of bed follow a footstep path with your flashlight to that light and turn it back on, 
                if you deviate from the path your screen gets blacker until you can’t see anything you have an attack and loses. 
                The lamp can also break so when that happens you walk to your closet and grab a new lamp to replace it, 
                your heart races faster and faster if the light is on for too long. 
                If your heart goes too fast, you’ll have a seizure and lose. 
                Then you have two windows on the side, 
                sometimes one opens and you as a player have to get out of bed again to follow the same path with your flashlight and close the window, 
                but the monster won’t let you close the window too easily so you have to spam a button as hard as you can because the window keeps going up by the monster to close the window. 
                If this takes too long, 
                the monster gets too close to the window, 
                you will be attacked and you lose. 
                Then you have the door right in front of you, 
                sometimes it will open and you will be stared at by the monster, 
                hide under the bed to avoid him if you don’t do this your light will flicker faster and faster and you will be attacked and you lose. 
                Avoid this by hiding under your blanket. 
                But don’t hide under the blanket for too long because you have claustrophobia and are not good in small spaces. 
                If you lie under the covers for too long, 
                you will have a panic attack and lose. 
                Get as much sleep as possible at 6AM and win or you will be attacked and lose.
                
                <h2>Goal: </h2>
                Get as much sleep as possible in 6 hours (12 minutes) and survive. <br>
