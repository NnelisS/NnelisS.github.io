                    <p>In this project i've created a lot of various scripts for the mini games and mechanics of the game,
                       so if you want to see all code created there is a link to the github page on this page.<br><br></p>
                    <p>Here is a picture for the tooltips in the game how to survive. 
                      Just to get a bit of understanding how I created some scripts.<br><br></p>
                    <img src="/Pictures/Tooltips.png" style="width: 800px;" alt="Random Image">
                    <p><br><br>I first created the path for the room the player can walk on.
                    This was mainly fun to create because it was my first time using physics.
                    In this mechanic the player has a flashlight and on the floor of the room there are footsteps where you as player can walk on.
                    Point the flashlight on the ground to reveal the footstep path. 
                    What I do in this script is create a local collider array that gets the component in all footstep the flashlight sees.
                    I then enter the array with a forloop to enter every footsteps FootstepGlow script to set their alpha to 1 and making them reveal themselfs on the ground.
                    What the FootstepGlow script does on every footstep is automatically fades them to 0 alpha, but when the overlapsphere enters is do that same but faster to 1 alpha.
                    Because the FootstepGlow script always lerps to 0 alpha it creates an illusion of the footstep glowing up and down because it goes both ways in the lerp.</p>

                    <p><br><br>I Then created the script for the main mechanic of the game and that's the bed.
                      The goal of the bed is to get as much sleep as possible before 6AM.
                      How I would change it now is to shorten out the scripts and play less around with bools since I used a lot of booleans to gain info on where the player is at and what the player is able to do.

                    What I created here is a system that chooses a random event of happening, such as: <br>- Lamps (on of the four lamps in the rooms will break. Pick up a light bulb on your desk and replace the broken light).<br> 
                    - Window(One of the 2 windows will open on both sides of the room, when the window is fully opened the monster will come closer to the window, close it before the monster reaches the window).<br>
                    - Door(the door in front of the bed will open. Your goal is to get in bed as quick as possible and hide under the blanket untill you hear the door closing. don't stay under the blanket for too long or you will have no breath left with your claustrophobia).</p>

                    <p>This script chooses a random event from the event list and will activate that event. 
                       also as times passes by your luck of having an event starting the random time a new event starts also goes down so you need to do everything faster as you progress on learning the game.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>As an extra I created realtime clock that show (AM/PM) or (00:00) instead of just one number. 
                       to that I added the eye closing time for the eyes for the game objective so you have to close your eyes for at least 120 second or 2 minutes.

            <h2>Date: Apr 16, 2022</h2>
            <h1>- Project: Minimal Prototype Design</h1>
            <h1>– Duration: 4 Weeks</h1>
            <h1>– Team: 1 Dev</h1>
            <p>My Part: Contract, Room Design, Mini games, Footstep manager, Lamp Manager, Window Manager, Door Manager, Event System,  Sound Manager, Animations, Cutscenes</p>
            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>For this project I signed an own made contract and made everything I put in the contract. 
                I made a game that looked like the Five Nights at Freddy’s type games that you need to survive till 6 AM. 
                Keep the lights on is a game in which the player has to try to get as much sleep as possible but his room is haunted by a monster that disturbs your sleep. 
                Change lights, close windows and hide to survive the night <br><br></p>
            <h2>Gameplay (Extended)</h2>
            <p>
                The players make sure to keep their eyes closed as long as possible to get some sleep in bed.
                When the lights in your room go out get out of bed follow a footstep path with your flashlight to that light and turn it back on, 
                if you deviate from the path your screen gets blacker until you can’t see anything you have an attack and loses. 
                The lamp can also break so when that happens you walk to your closet and grab a new lamp to replace it, 
                your heart races faster and faster if the light is on for too long. 
                If your heart goes too fast, you’ll have a seizure and lose. 
                Then you have two windows on the side, 
                sometimes one opens and you as a player have to get out of bed again to follow the same path with your flashlight and close the window, 
                but the monster won’t let you close the window too easily so you have to spam a button as hard as you can because the window keeps going up by the monster to close the window. 
                If this takes too long, 
                the monster gets too close to the window, 
                you will be attacked and you lose. 
                Then you have the door right in front of you, 
                sometimes it will open and you will be stared at by the monster, 
                hide under the bed to avoid him if you don’t do this your light will flicker faster and faster and you will be attacked and you lose. 
                Avoid this by hiding under your blanket. 
                But don’t hide under the blanket for too long because you have claustrophobia and are not good in small spaces. 
                If you lie under the covers for too long, 
                you will have a panic attack and lose. 
                Get as much sleep as possible at 6AM and win or you will be attacked and lose.
                
                <h2>Goal: </h2>
                Get as much sleep as possible in 6 hours (12 minutes) and survive. <br>
                
                <h2>Procedures: </h2>
               
                – Turn on lights <br>
                – Replace lights with new lamp from a closet<br>
                – Follow room path with a flashlight<br>
                – Close the window by pressing a key<br>
                – Hide under your covers when the door opens<br>
                – Close your eyes with (key) to get sleep<br>

                
                <h2>Lines: </h2>
                – Get as much sleep as possible at the end (6AM) <br>
                – Do not step out of the path you have to follow in the room <br>
                – Don’t leave the light off for too long or you’ll have a panic attack <br>
                – Don’t stare at the monster staring at you at the door <br>
                – Leave the window open just too long otherwise the monster will attack you. <br>
                – Replace a lamp from the cabinet if it breaks<br>
                
                <h2>Raw materials:</h2>
                – Take a lamp from the cupboard for replacement <br>
                – Make sure you get enough sleep in the time you have <br>

                – Player against time <br>
                – The monster that keeps you from sleeping <br>
                
                <h2>Limits:</h2>
                You can’t get out of the room and if you walk through the room you have to follow a path otherwise you will have a panic attack.</p>
