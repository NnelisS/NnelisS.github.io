                    <p>I've improved a lot over the past years so if I would recreate this I would change the health icon list, because now they are all dragged in individually.
                       I would now create and array that just enters [child] and would indicate current health to the child position in the array.
                       But since I was still learning when this project was created this is a good working script for a health manager.</p>

                    <p><br><br>In this project i went all in on the look of the game. cutscenes, animation, pickups, level design and Particles.</p>

                    <p><br><br>I recreated the tutorial level first for the first level with an intro cutscene, informational cutscene and outro cutscene.</p>

                    <p><br><br>I also polished some door by creating animations for it when you get close so the game gives more feeling when playing it.
                        I made an ontrigger collider on the door that when the player enters the animation state would turn true and open.
                        Ever since this animation I also found out that animation work in the global world of the scene, what I mean with this is that I made multiple animation for doors since some door where in different positions and rotations.
                        I found out that by creating the animation inside the child of an parent it would use the local space the parent provides.
                        this fixed a lot since you only have to move or rotate the parent and the child will always stay the same as it's local animation/position/rotation.

                    <p><br><br>I created some particles and lights around the map an the player since we've chosen a darker theme for the map
                               I gave the player to have the ability to look around with a flashlight.
                               Also I gave the player bullets a small particle explosion to indicate that the bullet had collision.</p>

            <p>We made a twin stick shooter for pc as our end project for year 1. 
                Our idea was to make a game that played in space, you are a little robot stuck in a broken ship. 
                You make your way thru the ship but are stopped by enemy robots. 
                Shoot, Move and complete puzzles to make your way to an escape pod<br><br></p>
