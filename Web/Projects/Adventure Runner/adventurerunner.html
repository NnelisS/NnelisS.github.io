                    <p>For this project we had 2 weeks to finish.

                        I mainly worked on the coolness of the game so: Player animations, animations, cutscenes, effect, transitions, scenes switches and the camera movement (cinemachine).</p>
                    
                        <p><br><br>I first started the most important thing in the game, the checkpoint system.
                        I created this by putting ontrigger around the map where you can die.
                        Then I put transform inside those triggers where the player should spawn back to.
                        And best for last I added a fade-in-out when u fall out of the map so it respawns exactly when the screen turns black.
                        If I would change this script I would change the bools for wich checkpoint your at to one int variable with every checkpoint as +int.
                        and also instead of a timer that runs out for the player to spawn back at the checkpoint I would change it to 1 coroutine with an if statement that goes to a function that checks with checkpoint to spawn at with the int variable.</p>

                    <p><br><br>I thought of something new to learn and I thought to myself for a fun way of switching scenes.
                    So I created a script that needs an int(build scene list) that switches to that scene.
                    this script basically works as a tool for buttons or events to switch the scene to the right one.</p>
<pre><code>using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using UnityEngine.UI;
    
    public class SceneSwitch : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public GameObject LoadingScreen;
        public Slider loadingBar;
    
        public void PlayGame(int levelIndex)
        {
            StartCoroutine(LoadSceneAsynchronously(levelIndex));
        }
    
        //change the first scene with a loading screen
        IEnumerator LoadSceneAsynchronously(int levelIndex)
        {
            AsyncOperation operation = SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(levelIndex);
            LoadingScreen.SetActive(true);
            while (!operation.isDone)
            {
                loadingBar.value = operation.progress;
                yield return null;
            }
    
        }
    }</code></pre>

                    <p><br><br>while this switching happens a different script for the scenemanager is turned on for the update of the sceneloading.
                    what this does is that it loads a scene above another scene for seemless switching of gamescenes with a loadingscreen in between.
                    Then when the next scene that needs to be loaded in is fully loaded the scene from before unloads and the loadingscreen is set to false/off.</p>
<pre><code>using TMPro;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using UnityEngine.UI;
    
    public class LoadingsSceneManager : MonoBehaviour

        public static LoadingsSceneManager instance;

        private void Awake()
        {
            instance = this;
    
            SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync((int)SceneIndexes.TITLE_SCREEN, LoadSceneMode.Additive);
        }

        {
            loadingScreen.gameObject.SetActive(true);
    
            // all scenes it needs to load or unload
            sceneLoading.Add(SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync((int)SceneIndexes.TITLE_SCREEN));
            sceneLoading.Add(SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync((int)SceneIndexes.MAP, LoadSceneMode.Additive));

                    <p><br><br>We start the game with a cutscene that I made myself with the camera(cine machine).

                        After the cutscene you will see the option play and if you click on that it will go to the next scene, 
                        the game scene. you will see the same image again as when you ended on the cutscene and you can click on start. 
                        What happens then is the camera flies towards the player, 
                        the player gets up from his sitting position and can start walking. 
                        I made this myself with animation and cinemachine.</p>

                    <p><br><br>Next on the list was the first puzzle animation/cutscene. 
                        When Pushing the box onto the pressure plate the gate opens up a bit and u can use the slide mechanic to continue.
                        When the gate open I used cinemachine transitions to show the play what u just achieved.</p>

                    <p><br><br>Next thing was the stairs transition. 
                        I create a cinematic transition in the screen and the camera to make the walk extra cinematic.
                    It gives a lot of feeling to the game since it's the first and only different camera view we have in the game.</p>

                    <p><br><br>And then the last thing I did to make the game end is making a cutscene that makes it look like there is way more to explore then just this level by showing a monster and the world out there.</p>
