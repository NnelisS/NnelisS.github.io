                    <p>For this project we had 2 weeks to finish.

                        I mainly worked on the coolness of the game so: Player animations, animations, cutscenes, effect, transitions, scenes switches and the camera movement (cinemachine).</p>
                    
                        <p><br><br>I first started the most important thing in the game, the checkpoint system.
                        I created this by putting ontrigger around the map where you can die.
                        Then I put transform inside those triggers where the player should spawn back to.
                        And best for last I added a fade-in-out when u fall out of the map so it respawns exactly when the screen turns black.</p>

                    <p><br><br>We start the game with a cutscene that I made myself with the camera(cine machine).

                        After the cutscene you will see the option play and if you click on that it will go to the next scene, 
                        the game scene. you will see the same image again as when you ended on the cutscene and you can click on start. 
                        What happens then is the camera flies towards the player, 
                        the player gets up from his sitting position and can start walking. 
                        I made this myself with animation and cinemachine.</p>

                    <p><br><br>Next on the list was the first puzzle animation/cutscene. 
                        When Pushing the box onto the pressure plate the gate opens up a bit and u can use the slide mechanic to continue.
                        When the gate open I used cinemachine transitions to show the play what u just achieved.</p>

                    <p><br><br>Next thing was the stairs transition. 
                        I create a cinematic transition in the screen and the camera to make the walk extra cinematic.
                    It gives a lot of feeling to the game since it's the first and only different camera view we have in the game.</p>

                    <p><br><br>And then the last thing I did to make the game end is making a cutscene that makes it look like there is way more to explore then just this level by showing a monster and the world out there.</p>

            <p>The idea of this project to make an endless runner. 
                we had an idea to scrap the endless runner and make it a adventure runner so you really looked at the cutscenes, animations, visuals, art, particles and sounds. 
                To show what we can do.<br><br></p>
