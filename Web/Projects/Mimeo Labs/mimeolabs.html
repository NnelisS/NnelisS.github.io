                    <p>I started this project making an really smooth controlled pickup system, I achieved this by adding damping, jiggle effect, rotation and throwing.

                        <br>Together it looks like this:</p>

                    <p><br><br>Besides the pickup system I created </p>
    

                    <p><br><br>I first started creating the most important mechanic in the game: Movement. 
                        I brainstormed about what car mechanics I wanted to use and chose for a challenge with wheel colliders. 
                    Wheel colliders have lots of potential to good physics on a car movement mechanic, such as friction, suspension and stiffness.</p>

                    <p><br><br>I created a script for all 4 wheels assigning: TurnAngle, WheelCollider, Mesh and Powered(if the wheel uses acceleration or only rolls).</p>
                    <pre><code>CODE!!</code></pre>
                    <img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="Random Image">

                    <p><br><br>Then I created a script for the main body of the car where input is added and also the wheels are attached to.</p>
                    <pre><code>CODE!!</code></pre>
                    <img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="Random Image">

                    <p><br><br>I also added the option to change the camera of the car to 3 position: third person view, car camera(slighlty above the player) and player point of view.</p>
                    <pre><code>CODE!!</code></pre>
                    <img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="Random Image">

                    <p><br><br>After the car was working properly I went after the second most important thing in the game: Laptime.
                    I created a script that doesn't only saves the laptimes but also converts them to minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
                    As extra I created the function to add all times together into one final game time.</p>

                    <p><br><br>I added the speedometer to the game with the asset the artists provided me that indicates realtime speed in km/h, throttle and brake.</p>

                    <p><br><br>After all important mechanics were finished I used my spare time to create some animations for the game and main menu and also creating a short cutscene for when u finish the race and a starting screen showcasing some racing moments from formula 1.</p>

            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>In project Short Burn, me and a small group tried to achieve the highest possible quality in an indie First Person Puzzler. Our core mechanic is to record your movement(Movement, Rotation) and spawn a clone that does that exact movement.

                we made this game with the following game design patterns:
                
                Flow, Pacing, Cells, Portals, Pick ups, Lay-out<br><br></p>
